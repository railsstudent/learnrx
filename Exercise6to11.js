/* Filtering Arrays

Like projection, filtering an array is also a very common operation. 
To filter an array we apply a test to each item in the array and collect the 
items that pass into a new array.
Exercise 6: Use forEach() to collect only those videos with a rating of 5.0

Use forEach() to loop through the videos in the newReleases array and, if a 
video has a rating of 5.0, add it to the videos array.
